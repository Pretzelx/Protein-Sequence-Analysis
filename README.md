# Protein Sequence Clustering with PCA

This project generates random protein sequences, clusters them using K-Means, and visualises the clusters using PCA.

## Features
- **Random Sequence Generation:** Generate random protein sequences with customisable length.
- **K-Means Clustering:** Cluster sequences based on their ecoded sequence.
- **PCA Visualization:** Visualize clusters in 2D space using Principal Component Analysis.

## Code Structure
**sequence_generation.py:** Contains functions to generate random protein sequences.

**clustering.py:** Encodes sequences and performs clustering using K-Means.

**visualisation.py:** Visualizes the clustered sequences using PCA.

**main.py:** Orchestrates the sequence generation, clustering, and visualisation.
